# ReadingApp_BE
Back-End

Every update:

Delete node_modules folder

Delete yarn.lock

Delete package_lock.json

Do: yarn install

then to run it: npm start

NEW WAY WITH BE AND FE COMBINED:
1 - Pull v2-dev branch from backend.

2 - Edit .env file in backend (I guess you should change the RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY & GOOGLE_API_KEY & GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID)

3 - RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY= [see Discord]

4 - GOOGLE_API_KEY= [see Discord]

5 - GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID= [see Discord]

6 - In VSCode, run "yarn dev"

7 - In browser, type in URL - "http://localhost:5000/"

Then you can see the page.
